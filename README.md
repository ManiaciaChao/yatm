> yet another teachermate helper

## Features

* Multi-mode sign-in support: normal, GPS and QR code.
* Sign in **WITHOUT any assistance** from your classmates
* System-level notification support (test on windows 10 & macOS & gnome)
* Active development
* <del>Docker support</del>

## Install

Simply download the latest release.

or you can build on your own.

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Configuration

**Edit your `config.json` first:**

```javascript
{
  "interval": 3000, // 轮询间隔，单位 ms
  // 用于 GPS 签到（大概是 Google 坐标）
  "lat": 30.511227, // 纬度
  "lon": 114.41021, // 经度
  // 用于二维码签到
  "name": "张三" // 微助教用户名，判断签到是否成功
  "ua": "" // 建议使用自己的 UA
}
```

## Usage

### Get your `openId`

Get your `openId` from WeChat official account `微助教服务号`. [How?](./AcquireOpenID.md)

**Notice that `openId` will expire after thousands of requests or another entrace from WeChat.**

### Run the script

Run the script, then paste your `openId` into console:

```sh
yarn start
```

or with environments:

```sh
env OPEN_ID=${your openId} yarn start
```

For normal & GPS sign-in, the process is automatic. You don't need to care about anything.

### For QR Code sign-in

Due to the limitation of WeChat API, things are quite different for QR code sign-in.  

The script will subscribe the sign-in URL generated by teachermate's server, and print its corresponding QR code to the console when it updates.

You're expected to scan the QR code **manually via WeChat** from your console.

Attention that **the script WILL EXIT INSTANTLY when success, because a QR scan
via WeChat will causes the update of `openId`. You have to reacquire your new
`openId` and run this script again!**
